For example:\nAllergens that are breathed in often cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus production, cough, or wheezing. Allergens that touch the eyes may cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes. Eating something you are allergic to can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, or a severe, life-threatening reaction. Allergens that touch the skin can cause a skin rash, hives, itching, blisters, or even skin peeling. Drug allergies usually involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms."
